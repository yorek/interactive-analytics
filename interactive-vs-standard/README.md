# Interactive vs Standard: Snowflake parallel load test

Compares query latency and query per second between a standard warehouse (`STD_WH`) and an
interactive warehouse (`IW_WH`) by running a chosen a sample **workload**
(one of two query shapes) in parallel across N simulated users.

> **End-to-end test:** This benchmark measures the full client-to-Snowflake round trip, not
> server-side query time alone. Results are therefore affected by **network latency** and
> **current CPU usage** on your machine (thread scheduling, connector overhead, etc.).
> Run under similar conditions when comparing warehouses or repeating a run.

## What it does

1. Connects to Snowflake using a named connection from
   `~/.snowflake/connections.toml` (default `PM`, externalbrowser SSO).
   Connections use **qmark** parameter binding (`?` placeholders).
2. Prints **`[init]`** (database, schema, workload, seed) and a short
   **`[workload]`** description for the selected query shape.
3. Logs combined row counts for `CATALOG_SALES_IT` and `DATE_DIM_IT` via
   **`[tables]`**.
4. Resolves warehouse sizes with `SHOW WAREHOUSES IN ACCOUNT` and logs them
   under **`[warehouse]`**.
5. Preloads up to `--sample-size` distinct `cs_item_sk` values from
   `CATALOG_SALES_IT` joined to `DATE_DIM_IT` (year 1999) in your target
   database/schema.
6. Before an interactive warehouse run, **`[interactive]`** checks warehouse
   state, resumes it if suspended, and (only after a resume) estimates cache
   warm time from attached table sizes at ~300 MB/s.
7. Spawns N threads. Each thread opens its own connection, sets the target
   warehouse, disables result cache, runs one warmup query, then runs I timed
   queries — each with a randomly chosen `cs_item_sk` from the preloaded pool.
8. Prints latency stats (avg / min / p50 / p95 / p99 / max), throughput (q/s),
   and average result rows per query.
9. With `--compare`, runs two warehouses back-to-back (same RNG seed, workload,
   and item pool for fairness) and prints a side-by-side delta table.

## Workloads (`--workload`)

Both workloads join `CATALOG_SALES_IT` to `DATE_DIM_IT` and filter on a bound
`cs_item_sk` (and `d_year = 1999` for query1).

| value    | default | purpose |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| `query1` | **yes** | Full analytical path: join, 1999 filter, `GROUP BY d_date`, `ORDER BY d_date` — primary comparison workload. |
| `query2` | no      | Same join/filter as query1 but `LIMIT 1` — stops after the first matching row. |

Omit `--workload` to use **query1**.

## Setup

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Dependencies are declared
in `pyproject.toml` and locked in `uv.lock`. `uv run` syncs the environment
automatically on first use.

Make sure your `~/.snowflake/connections.toml` has a working connection (the
default this script targets is `PM`).

The target schema must contain `CATALOG_SALES_IT` and `DATE_DIM_IT` (defaults:
database `IW_PLAYGROUND`, schema `IW_TEST`).

## Usage

Single warehouse:

```bash
uv run iwtest.py --users 20 --iterations 10 --warehouse STD_WH
uv run iwtest.py --users 20 --iterations 10 --warehouse IW_WH
```

Pick a workload (default is query1):

```bash
uv run iwtest.py --users 20 --iterations 10 --warehouse STD_WH --workload query1
uv run iwtest.py --users 20 --iterations 10 --warehouse STD_WH --workload query2
```

Side-by-side comparison:

```bash
uv run iwtest.py --users 20 --iterations 10 --compare STD_WH,IW_WH
```

Reproducible run with a fixed seed (default is `42`):

```bash
uv run iwtest.py --users 20 --iterations 10 --compare STD_WH,IW_WH --seed 42
```

Non-reproducible run (new RNG seed each time):

```bash
uv run iwtest.py --users 20 --iterations 10 --compare STD_WH,IW_WH --seed random
```

### Flags

| flag             | default              | description |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| `--users`        | 10                   | concurrent users (threads) |
| `--iterations`   | 10                   | queries per user |
| `--warehouse`    | —                    | `STD_WH` or `IW_WH` (single mode) |
| `--compare`      | —                    | compare two warehouses back-to-back, e.g. `STD_WH,IW_WH` |
| `--workload`     | `query1`             | `query1` or `query2` (see table above) |
| `--connection`   | `PM`                 | Snowflake connection name |
| `--database`     | `IW_PLAYGROUND`      | database containing TPC-DS tables |
| `--schema`       | `IW_TEST`            | schema with `CATALOG_SALES_IT` / `DATE_DIM_IT` |
| `--sample-size`  | 5000                 | distinct `cs_item_sk` values to preload |
| `--seed`         | `42`                 | RNG seed; use `random` for a different seed each run |

`--warehouse` and `--compare` are mutually exclusive; one is required.
